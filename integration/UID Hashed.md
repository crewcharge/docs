## Deprecated 1.0.5  - Why does Crewcharge use Hashes of User Ids (uid_hashed)? 

:::warning important takeaway 

UID Hashes in Crewcharge starting from 1.0.5 no longer have to be generated by you.
Internally we still use the same hashing mechanism with better improvements to adhere to our strict security guidelines.

As a customer of Crewcharge, you solely responsible for the business and user data imported into our product,
making you the Data Controller.

However, we make sure

To log a trigger, you also need a **uid_hashed**.
Think of this like a primary key for accessing customer information.

- A hash function is a one way function that always returns the same result, but
  can&apos;t be traced back to the original value.

- UID hashed must be a hash of a identifier of the user. Best example is database
  id, email or phone number.

- Never use uid_hashes that can identify a user personally.

- All uid hashes must start with your project key **YOUR-PROJECT-KEY**_

We use SHA-3 256 in our libraries, some might safer with a smaller hash function, feel free to use any
hashing function.

But make sure you are hashing the id before attaching the user.

:::warning important takeaway

UID Hashes in Crewcharge starting from 1.0.5 no longer have to be generated on the client side.
Internally we still use the same hashing mechanism to adhere to our strict security guidelines.
