## Getting a project's analytics tag

An [analytics tag](/integration/Analytics%20Tag) is used in both front-end applications and backend applications.
It identifies your project separately and can update logs on what user actions have been done.

While protecting an analytics key in the backend is nice, it's still inevitable since .env files aren't really safe from front-end applications.
We recommend users perform backend analytics to prevent click jacking, **and at NO COST keep the [API Key](/integration/API%20Key) on the front-end.**
