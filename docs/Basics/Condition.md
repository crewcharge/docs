# Condition

## What is a condition-step?

A condition step is a type of [workflow-step](/Basics/Step) that decides if the workflow must continue for a specific user/ user-group.

## Examples of Condition-Step

1. If the user is a **paid user**, send them a feedback survey.
2. If the user has visited the site once every week for 4 weeks, do X.

Simply put, it helps us filter out if a workflow sequence must continue for the particular user or user-group.
